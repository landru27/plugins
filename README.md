# ScriptCraft Hub
ScriptCraft Hub is a place for the ScriptCraft user community to find and share scripts, information, and ideas for making the most of ScriptCraft.

ScriptCraft is a Minecraft plugin for writing Minecraft mods in JavaScript.  ScriptCraft was created and is maintained by @walterhiggins.  ScriptCraft comes with a rich set of plugins, and has a lot of useful information for installing, getting started with, and utilizing its API.  The purpose of ScriptCraft Hub is to augment that with contributions from the community.

# plugins
The initial repo within ScriptCraft Hub is its `plugins` repo, as a clearinghouse of users' ScriptCraft plugins.

The directory structure provides a loose sort of organization; contributors are invited to place their scripts in whatever directory makes the most sense to them, or to add a new directory if none of the existing ones is suitable.


### contributing

If you have a ScriptCraft plugin you'd like to share, simply fork this repo, commit your script to your fork, and open a pull request to merge it back in here.

Since pull requests are closed after being merged, please provide documentation for your script as code comments inside the script itself; or, for more extensive documentation, provide brief code comments about where to find the complete documentation, such as your GitHub repo, blog, webpage, etc.

Generally, authors will be added to the list of contributors on this page, but if you don't want to be listed, or would like to be listed in a particular way, just say so in your PR.  You can also open a PR against this file, adding / modifying / removing your author information.

### installation
One guiding aim for this repo is to keep it simple to add or update these plugins on a ScriptCraft server.  The suggested approach is to make a 'scriptcrafthub' directory, e.g., `/opt/spigot/scriptcraft/plugins/scriptcrafthub`, download this repo as a .zip file, and unzip that file inside your `scriptcrafthub` directory.  It should also be possible to simply maintain a git working copy at `/opt/spigot/scriptcraft/plugins/scriptcrafthub/plugins`, and `git fetch` as needed.

### contributors

You can (usually) use the commit for a given contribution to trace back to the GitHub repo of its author, but a consolidated list of contributors is provided here.
